# Univariate Visualizations

Covered in this section:
Bar charts (categorical) and histograms (quantitative)

In this course, it is expected that your data is organized in some kind of tidy format. In short, a [tidy dataset](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) is a tabular dataset where:

* each variable is a column
* each observation is a row
* each type of observational unit is a table
